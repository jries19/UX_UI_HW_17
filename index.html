                    I discovered a passion for UI/UX Design while learning about web design in college. I love how involved users are in the process and seeing the final product come alive thanks to the collaboration of so many different processes and teams. I also love how UI/UX Design has people from so many different backgrounds, I think it creates so many wonderful opportunities to learn from one another.

                    I also have a passion for reading and storytelling. My favorite part of a book is always the characters. I enjoy getting to see them grow and learn as the story progresses, especially when the characters are able to surprise me with how they shape the story.
